This document outlines the steps to set up mirroring (high availability and redundancy) for your application using Kubernetes. The guide covers containerizing your application, creating a Deployment, exposing it with a Service, and managing scaling and updates.

## 1. Containerize Your Application

First, ensure your application is containerized. Here is an example of a simple Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
FROM node:14
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### Build and Push the Image

Build your Docker image and push it to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub):

```bash
docker build -t my-app-image:latest .
docker push my-app-image:latest
```

## 2. Create a Kubernetes Deployment

Define a Deployment YAML file to specify the number of replicas and the container image to use.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3  # Number of replicas (mirrors) for high availability
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-app-container
        image: my-app-image:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

### Apply the Deployment

Apply the Deployment configuration using \`kubectl\`:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

Kubernetes will create three pods (replicas) and distribute them across the nodes in the cluster.

## 3. Expose the Deployment Using a Service

To make your application accessible, create a Service:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-app-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
  type: LoadBalancer  # Use NodePort or ClusterIP if LoadBalancer is not supported
```

### Apply the Service

Apply the Service configuration:

```bash
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
```

The Service will load balance traffic across the three replicas of your application.

## 4. Monitor and Manage the Deployment

### Scaling the Deployment

To scale the number of replicas:

```bash
kubectl scale deployment my-app-deployment --replicas=5
```

This command adjusts the number of running pods.

### Updating the Application

To update your application, update the image in your Deployment, and Kubernetes will perform a rolling update:

```bash
kubectl set image deployment/my-app-deployment my-app-container=my-app-image:v2
```

### Rollback an Update

If something goes wrong during an update, you can roll back to the previous version:

```bash
kubectl rollout undo deployment/my-app-deployment
```

## 5. Advanced Concepts

### Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)

Kubernetes can automatically scale the number of pod replicas based on CPU utilization or other custom metrics:

```bash
kubectl autoscale deployment my-app-deployment --cpu-percent=50 --min=3 --max=10
```

### Multi-Region Mirroring

For disaster recovery and global load balancing, consider deploying your application across multiple Kubernetes clusters in different regions using Kubernetes Federation, multi-cluster services, or a service mesh like Istio.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can set up mirroring in Kubernetes to ensure high availability and fault tolerance for your application. Kubernetes handles load balancing, scaling, and managing the lifecycle of your application instances, allowing you to focus on development.
